## Guideline to run files. <br/>
**Markdown files.** <br/>
There are 2 markdown files which explain the goal of every script in this repositoty. <br/>
Their names: 'Human_paralogs.md' and 'Gene_order_finder.md'. <br/>

**Run files.** <br/>
script_all.sh : This bash file contains the code for the whole process (until now) with 'calls' to the others scripts.<br/>
To run this locally: <br/>
*Download* all files mentioned as script1 AND the bash script named script_all.sh .<br/>
Copy the requested files to !!!--- *your Home directory* ---!!! . <br/>
Go to cmd line and run : chmod +x script_all.sh
